- boxplot_by_group(df, group, var, outliers): boxplot for a numerical variable of interest vs a categorical variable. with or without outliers. includes data mean and mean by category
**Univariate Analysis**
- The variables "Unnamed: 0" have a uniform distribution
- The numerical variables have a shift to the right
- The categorical variables are not balanced, with 79% of properties as "apartments" and 78% of units concentrated in 50% of the sample neighbourhoods
- 75% of the apartment units have up to 3 bedrooms and up to 2 bathrooms with an average size of 85m2.
- 75% of the units in Eixample have up to 3 bedrooms and up to 2 bathrooms with an average size of 87m2.
**Bivariate Analysis**
- 'square_meters' has a positive correlation with 'price', 'rooms' and 'bathrooms'
- 'square_meters_price' has a negative correlation with 'square_meters', 'rooms' and 'bathrooms'
- There are only one couple of variables with high correlation: bathroom-square_meters (0.75)
- The most popular unit configuration in the dataset is 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom with 1836 units (21% of all units).
- Other popular configurations are 1-1 (18%), 3-2 (14%), 3-1 (13%), 2-2 (9%) and 4-2 (8%)
- These six most popular unit configurations represent 86% of all units
- The "df_pop" data frame includes the most popular units in terms of bedroom/bathroom configuration, representing 94% of the samples
- Sarrià-Sant Gervasi, Les Corts, Eixample and San Martí are the most expensive neighbourhoods with average prices above the dataset average.
- Sants-Montjuïc, Horta-Guinardó, Sant Andreu and Nou Barris are the cheapest neighbourhoods with average prices below the dataset average.
- When comparing the price per square metre, Ciutat Vella and Eixample are the most expensive neighbourhoods. - If we compare square meters, Ciutat Vella is the second lowest and Eixample the third
- From the perspective of price per square meter, the most attractive neighborhood according to this data could be Les Corts, with an average surface area of ​​89.79 m2 above the average (78.67 m2) and a price per square meter of 15.85 below the average (17.79)
- From the perspective of price per square meter, the most attractive type of unit according to this data could be the apartment, with an average surface area of ​​80 m2 above the average (78.67 m2) and a price per square meter of 15.76 below the average (17.79)
- There are 1,777 flats in Eixample, being the most popular unit type and neighborhood combination, with 79.68% of the units in Eixample being flats, and 28.9% of the flats are in Eixample. - In Les Courts there are only 398 flats, which makes it far from the most popular type of housing and neighbourhood combination, although 87.67% of the dwellings in Les Courts are flats, only 6.47% of the flats are in Les Courts.
- Most types of units have a lift, in the case of flats the proportion is 74.12%
- Units with a terrace on the other hand, seem to be rare and very few have one

# Notes on Data Preprocesing
- Preprocessed data on a copy of the original dataset named df2
- Created a new category "unknown" in the variable 'real_state' replacing NaN
- Removed the variable "Unnamed: 0" which had no value for modeling
- There are outliers in all variables. df2.shape:(8188, 9)
- Applied the Z-score method, which removes outliers with more than 3 standard deviations. Some variables with a relevant percentage of outliers still remain. df3.shape:(7742, 9)
- Limited outliers to respective whisker boundaries. df4.shape:(7742, 9)
- Created dummy variables for variables 'real_state' and 'neighborhood'. df5.shape:(7742, 20)
- Boolean variables were converted to numeric
- Min-Max scaling was applied. The dataset has features with different scales, normalization ensures that no feature dominates the learning process.

# Notes on EDA (pre-modeling)
- The shape of the data for modeling (7742.20) does not account for outliers
- The data for modeling have no missing values ​​and all variables are numeric and scaled
- Low correlation between variables, with only a couple of variables having a high correlation (bathroom and square footage)

# Notes on Model Building
- In order to make statistical inferences from a logistic regression model, it is important to ensure that there is no multicollinearity present in the data.
- Data split 70/30. Shape of Training set :  (5419, 20), Shape of test set :  (2323, 20)
- Based on the provided results, here are some conclusions you can draw about the performance of each model:
- Performance Metrics:
    - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
    - **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors, giving more weight to larger errors.
    - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: The square root of MSE, providing error in the same units as the target variable.
    - **R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination)**: Indicates how well the model's predictions approximate the real data points. A value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.
- **Random Forest**: **Best Performance**. It has the lowest MAE (0.007370), MSE (0.000556), and RMSE (0.023589), and the highest R2 Score (0.990722), indicating it is the most accurate model among the ones tested.
- **Decision Tree**: **Second Best**. It also performs very well with low MAE (0.010382), MSE (0.001028), and RMSE (0.032058), and a high R2 Score (0.982863).
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**: **Good Performance**. It has a relatively low MAE (0.041981), MSE (0.003182), and RMSE (0.056408), with a high R2 Score (0.946942).
- **Linear Regression and Ridge Regression**: Similar Performance. Both have similar metrics with MAE around 0.042, MSE around 0.004, RMSE around 0.063, and R2 Score around 0.93, indicating decent performance.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Moderate Performance. It has higher MAE (0.059409), MSE (0.009173), and RMSE (0.095774), with a lower R2 Score (0.847047), indicating it is less accurate compared to the top models.
- **Lasso Regression**: Poor Performance: It has the highest MAE (0.196899), MSE (0.059972), and RMSE (0.244891), with a negative R2 Score (-0.000026), indicating it performs poorly on this dataset.
