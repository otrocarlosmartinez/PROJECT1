# Consolidated notes on Data Overview

- There are 8188 rows and 10 columns.
- The variable 'Unnamed' represent index and should be deleted from data
- Data types are aligned with information
- There is missing data (NaN) on variable 'real_state'. To be replaced by "other"
- There are four types of real states being the most common "flat"
- Most units do not have terrace
- Most units do have lift
- The neighborhood with largest unit count is "Eixample"
- Units size goes from 10m2 to 679m2, with a mean of 84.61m2
- Units prices goes from 320EUR to 15000EUR/month, with mean of 1444EUR/month
- price range is assumed referred to monthly rent, so considered as EUR per month
- Units prices by square meter goes from 4.9EUR/m2/month to 186EUR/m2/month, with mean of 17.7EUR/m2/month
- There are units listed with cero rooms (to be investigated)
- Target variable for modeling is "price"


# Consolidated notes on Exploratory Data Analysis

**Functions:**
- univariate_numerical(data): Function to generate two plots for each numerical variable. Histplot for variable distribution. Boxplot for statistical summary
- univariate_categorical(data): Function to generate countplot for each categorical variable. Labeled with count and percentage
- plot_crosstab_bar_count(df, var_interest): Function to create a barplot of crosstab of the variable of interest vs each of the rest of categorical variables. Labeled with counts
- plot_crosstab_heat_perc(df, var_interest): Function to create a heatmap of crosstab of the variable of interest vs each of the rest of catagorical variables. Labeled with counts, percentage by row, percentage by column
- boxplot_by_group(df, group, var, outliers): boxplot for a numerical variable of interest vs a categorical variable. with or without outliers. includes data mean and mean by category

**Missing value treatment:**
- created category "other" in 'real_state' variable replacing NaN

**Feature engineering:**
- Droped variable "Unnamed: 0" having no value for modeling
- There are units with cero rooms, considered real data.

**Outlier detection and treatment**
- There are outliers in all variables. Considered natural and not to be caped.

**Univariate Analysis**
- numerical variables have a right sqewed
- categorical variables are unbalanced, with 79% of real_state as "flat" and 78% of units concentrated on 50% of sample's neighbourhoods

**Bivariate Analysis**
- There is only one pair of variables with high correlation: bathroom-square_meters	(0.75)
- This correlation it does make sense and will be considered during modeling.
- The most popular unit configuration in dataset have 2 rooms and 1 bathroom with 1836 units (21% of all units).
- Other popular configurations are 1-1(18%), 3-2(14%), 3-1(13%), 2-2(9%) and 4-2(8%)
- Those six most popular unit configurations counts for 86% of all units
- Sarria-Sant Gervasi, Les Corts, and Eixample are the more expensive neighbourhoods with mean prices above dataset mean.
- Horta- Guinardo, Sant Andreu, Nou Barris are the cheapest neighbourhoods with mean prices bellow dataset mean.
- apartment and atic are the most expensive unit types together with "other" (being "other" the unit type created to replace NaN in original dataset)
- flat and study are the cheapest unit types with mean prices bellow dataset mean
- flats at Eixample is the most popular type of unit and neighbourhood combination, with 78.51% of units at Eixample being flats, and 28.98% of flats are at Eixample.
- most unit types in do have lift, in flats units the proportion is 74,12%
- terrace in the other hand seems to be rare and very few units across all neighbourhoods do have terrace

Horta- Guinardo, Sant Andreu, Gràcia, Ciutat Vella, Sarria-Sant Gervasi, Les Corts, Sant Martí, Eixample, Sants-Montjuïc, Nou Barris
